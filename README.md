# goTestHtmlReport
`goTestHtmlReport` generates a prettified html report of go-test logs.
## Installation 
```shell 
$ go install github.com/ehwg/goTestHtmlReport@latest
```
## Usage
To use the `goTestHtmlReport` with a go test log file use
 ```shell 
 $ goTestHtmlReport -f ./test.log -o ./reportDir
 ```
where `./test.log` generated by calling
 ```shell 
 $ go test -v -cover -json  ./...  |tee test.log 
 ```
Another way to use `goTestHtmlReport` is by reading the logs from stdout. Use the following command. 
 ```shell 
 $  go test -v -cover -json  ./... | goTestHtmlReport
 ```

## Interpreting html report
![](report.gif)

The html report groups test suites by packages and the test cases by test suites. Cards are collapsible if a package contains tests, or a test suite contains test cases. To view code coverage details on the cards pass the coverage flag in the go test command.
In case of errors the test can be collapsed and error log is shown.
